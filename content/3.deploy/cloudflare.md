## Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare Workers supports [static assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/), making it easy to deploy a Nuxt application. You can learn more about it on the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/nuxt/).

::note
You must set a compatibility date to `2024-09-19` or later in both `nuxt.config.ts` and `wrangler.toml`.
Checkout the [Nitro documentation](https://nitro.build/deploy/providers/cloudflare#cloudflare-module-workers) for the `cloudflare_module` preset.
:: 

::important
Cloudflare Static Assets is in Beta.

### Deploy With Wrangler

You can use [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk) to deploy your project to Cloudflare.

1. Create a `wangler.jsonc` 

```json [wrangler.jsonc]
{
	"$schema": "https://unpkg.com/wrangler@latest/config-schema.json",
	"compatibility_date": "2025-01-16",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
	"main": "./.output/server/index.mjs",
	"assets": {
		"directory": "./.output/public/",
		"binding": "ASSETS"
	}
}
```

2. Build your project for Cloudflare Workers:

    ```bash [Terminal]
    npx nuxi build --preset=cloudflare_module
    ```

3. Deploy, it will ask you to create a project for the first time:

    ```bash [Terminal]
    wrangler deploy
    ```

### Automatic Deploy With Git

If you're using GitHub or GitLab, Cloudflare workers has an integration to automatically deploy your project. 

::note
Checkout the [Workers Build](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/) documentation for the Git Integration.
::

::important
[Workers Build](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/) is in Beta.

## Cloudflare Pages

::tip
**Zero Configuration âœ¨**
:br
Integration with Cloudflare Pages is possible with zero configuration, [learn more](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy#zero-config-providers).
::

### Route matching

On CloudFlare Pages, if an HTML file is found with a matching path to the current route requested, it will serve it. It will also redirect HTML pages to their extension-less counterparts: for instance, `/contact.html` will be redirected to `/contact`, and `/about/index.html` will be redirected to `/about/`.

To match Cloudflare [route matching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/serving-pages/#route-matching) rules, set the nitro option `autoSubfolderIndex` to `false`.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      autoSubfolderIndex: false
    }
  }
})
```

### Git Integration

If you use the GitHub/GitLab integration with Cloudflare Pages, **no configuration is required**. Pushing to your repository will automatically build your project and deploy it.

::note
Nuxt will detect the environment to set the correct [Server/Nitro preset](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/cloudflare).
::

To leverage server-side rendering on the edge, set the build command to: `nuxt build`

To statically generate your website, set the build command to: `nuxt generate`

### Direct Upload

Alternatively, you can use [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk) to upload your project to Cloudflare.

In this case, you will have to set the preset manually.

1. Build your project for Cloudflare Pages:

    ```bash [Terminal]
    npx nuxi build --preset=cloudflare_pages
    ```

2. Deploy, it will ask you to create a project for the first time:

    ```bash [Terminal]
    wrangler pages deploy dist/
    ```
